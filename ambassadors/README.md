badge.py

Is a small app that updates an inky eInk display from Pimoroni. The code simply displays image /user/user.jpg, and then starts showing panels from /panels/ starting with panel1.jpg, and continues on until there are no more panel##.jpg files. When this occurs it goes back to the original user. This code is being used for a badge for my CTE ambassadors at school. Each student ambassador has a badge, and it rotates betweehn their name and some information about the school etc.
